# dotfiles
Super minimalistic dotfiles for a super minimalistic person

Note: these dotfiles as they are currently will only work for MacOS users, sorry other people üòÖ

## Installation
My dotfiles are still in need of cleaning up - they currently work for me but do not have a lot of structure to them. However if you would still like to install and use my dotfiles, simply run the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/nicholaswong31415/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
`cd ~/.dotfiles`
`sh ./bootstrap.setup.sh`

Thanks for taking the time to have a look at my dotfiles ‚ò∫Ô∏è
